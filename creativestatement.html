          My name is Ashley. I am a Senior History major student with the goal of becoming a Public Programs director. Currently, I am a public library assistant
          and a teaching assistant for an ESL adult learning program. my favorite form of media are video games, 
          i do not have formal experience in media arts aside from two years in multiple roles for my high school yearbook.
          through this class i hope to develop skills for professional roles that increasingly need problem solving through
          visual communication.

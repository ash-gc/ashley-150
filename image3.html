            The arc of the metal provided me different shape than the rectangular ones commonly found on the fourth floor and the curved line of the metal at a close angle reminded me of the golden spiral. 
            At the time when I was taking my photos, students were walking across the hallway and I was able to capture a student on the other end of the 
            hallway inside of the metal arc. When taking the photographs, I had to make a choice of subject between the metal arc or the students.
            If I was able to more practice with the DSLR camera, I could be more efficent in changing the camera settings to bring the students in the background into focus.
            In addition to moving the white point to the entire image, I adjusted the midtone slider to keep details of 
            the rusted metal. To make the metal arc look more like an upper jaw or teeth, I used the object selection tool and curve adjustment middle-point to remove
            the some of the yellow hue.

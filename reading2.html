            <h1> reading #2</h1>
                <p>
                    The primary method of engaging with the internet is through social media. Since then, people in the digital 
                    domain have become conditioned to filtering ourselves for algorithms. It is no wonder the author must contend 
                    with the onslaught of Generative Ai, much like me. Honestly, history and the news have stretched my suspension 
                    of disbelief more than Generative AI has. Cruelty and marvel tie human continuity forward. 
                </p>
                    One of the problems of Generative AI is entrapping people in a loop of self-gratifying narratives. 
                    I largely agree with the article, especially the sentiment of AI as a tool for lucrative “perversion” and “engagement”.
                    Generative AI represents technology at its worst, when it accelerates the scope of commodities. Generative AI is the 
                    shiny new tool for propaganda, mass market, and resource acquisition. It is free and accessible and everywhere. 
                    Everything is consumable. Nothing is sacred. Even before the current version of Generative AI, people were turned 
                    into fetish objects as commodities, self-inflicted or non-consensual. In turn, the digital domain is harder to discern with AI.  
                <p>
                    However, I don’t think AI gives infinite possibilities. It wants to be as accurate in its eagerness to console and affirm its
                    users. From my observations and what I’ve read, AI is an anti-social technology. It narrows opinion and perspective, reflecting
                    an insular mind. It reconstructs the internet into an individual ecosystem, where a utopia is filled with personalized pollution.
                    It serves no curiosity and regresses from an explorative digital space. As the author warns of AI’s tenacity of an imagined past,
                    it also rejects possible futures.
                </p>
                <p>
                    AI, as a digital perfect objective person, does not exist. Generative AI cannot reject prompt inputs and accepts the user’s desires.
                    Companies and individuals can avoid accountability behind the algorithm. There is no name to blame when the algorithm’s output causes
                    harm. Generative AI is presented to the public as the next step in accessibility. It obfuscates the intensity of resources, both 
                    labor and natural, it undergoes to produce content. Generative AI depends on human moderators and responders. They are often underpaid
                    and exposed to a large volume of content and demands. 
                </p> 
                <p>
                    Generative AI is dulling people’s discernment and fact-checking. As a student, Generative AI has created more problems. Students 
                    must dedicate effort to validating the accuracy of their information. We rely on searching for information outside established 
                    databases. Despite this, biases in research and sources paint a complicated world. A complicated world is what I find history
                    and art interesting and sobering.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Generative AI commodifies skill and time for instant results. It erases interaction and devalues specialization. It leaves less and
                    less room for collaboration and communication. Tearing ourselves away from the digital space to reject AI is a form of disengagement.
                    Then, how do we challenge the erasure of the world? We can start detangling from the pressures that seek a gratifying static perfect 
                    truth by accepting disappointment and limitation, making mistakes, and learning. In other words, the act of process can help us navigate
                    through reality and fantasy without shutting ourselves out.

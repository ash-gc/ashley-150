    <p>Hello, my name is Ashley Gonzalez.</p>
    <p>This is the portfolio page for my MEDPL150 site!</p>
    <p><h3>Creative Statement</h3>
    <p class="ex">I am a Senior History major student with the goal of becoming a Public Programs director. Currently, I am a public library assistant
    and a teaching assistant for an ESL adult learning program. My favorite form of media are video games,
    and my genre of choice is turn-based role playing games.
    I do not have formal experience in media arts aside from a year in multiple roles for my high school yearbook. 
    Through this class, I hope to develop skills for professional roles that increasingly need problem solving through visual communication.</p>

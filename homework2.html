                    The dimmed lights throughout the fourth floor of the North Building led to me raising the camera's ISO settings raised above the recommended 200 and affected my 
                    adjustment panel decisions later on. There was some difficulty in finding spaces with more lighting, but there was not much time to get familiar with
                    the camera and find a location. This meant my primary focus when adjusting the tonal range of the photographs was to brighten the photographs. I was able to brighten both pictures 
                    by moving the white point slider to the left on Curve adjustment panel. This method brought out a yellow color that emphasized the differences in hue for the "arrow" photograph. 
                    In the second photograph I chose for my shallow depth of field. On the second photograph, I also selected the metal arc as an object for its own tonal adjustment. 
                    On the Curve adjustment, I moved the midtone slider to keep details of the rusted metal and change the yellow hue. The most time I spent in photoshop was setting up my canvas and 
                    exporting the finished image. Although I opened photoshop with the Artboard web format preset with 1920px X 1080 px dimensions,I was not able to add the original photograph file 
                    to crop and adjust to the file created onto the canvas like it was demonstrated. I was most confused when exporting the pictures without decreasing the 
                    quality of the picture, which can be seen in the background and where components are not in focus. Looking at the preview for exporting with the recommended image settings, 
                    the image compression was very noticeable.

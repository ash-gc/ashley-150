<h1>lab photo: image2</h1>
<img src="image/image2.jpg" alt text="image2" width=40% height=40%>
<p>
    <em>5" x 7"</em>
</p>
<p>
    By cropping the photograph 5" x 7" ratio, I cleanly removed one of the sections in the original. The brightness from the adjustment layer created more contrast between the two 
    walls. The cropping changed the depth of field into something flatter than the original. The cropped out section gave me information through the scope of the image. 
    The image is still divided into three main sections, but the handrail forms a triangular shape at the bottom. As a result, the cropping changes the focus of the image 
    from the arrows to the diagonal line created by the handrail.

	                Participating in digital life with photography means navigating representations of reality. The notion of the "photograph-token" 
                    Sontag discusses in the chapter pre-dates digital life but has become the norm. Today, there is an abundance of
                    "photograph-tokens" and the power of them is overwhelming. The distance between image and experience is constantly shifting in digital spaces. 
                    Instantly, I can see an image displayed on a screen of myself before my experience can be internalized as memory. A self-portrait photo 
                    could communicate more about my profile as a consumer than my actual facial profile, unless it is for surveillance in which both profiles 
                    are of equal importance. In my experience, photography is a disorienting medium.

                    In terms of photographic record, fidelity is a major preoccupation of mine. Similarly to Sontag's observation of the democratization 
                    through the camera, there is an increasing social responsibility to compose the "photograph-token" that is the most authentic memory 
                    in group consensus. Digital life is one of the ways we process and confirm reality. As a result, vision and the dissemination of it 
                    is privileged in our society. However, social media as public record drives everyday people to a compulsion for the best record of 
                    the moment. This is not inherently new but adds sets of self-selective behaviors we filter ourselves and perceive each other through.

                    Although not divorced from the exchange of ideas, I prefer to capture images of landscapes and graphics in my personal collection. 
                    I am not immune to tokenizing my own experiences and changing my behavior due to the importance of digital life and evidencing any 
                    life at all. However, I am self-conscious about how faithful I represent experiences and the pressure of confining them in 
                    “photograph-tokens”.

                    I feel the most conflicted with "photograph-tokens" and social responsibility whenever I take photographs for work because I 
                    would like to record an authentic memory of the subjects. Our world at this moment is accustomed to photography with and without
                    our consent. Working at a non-profit, the ubiquity of the camera phone does allow me as to blend in and out during events. 
                    The camera phone is less authoritative in person, but still intrusive. When tasked to take pictures, my goal is to steer away
                    from depicting the people we are providing services to as objects, which give me profound discomfort. The essay's conclusion
                    rings partially true when Sontag states photography as an obsession to resolve experience. For my job, the photographs are 
                    taken to convey a declarative point in peoples' lives when that is often not the case. However, the slices of time depicted
                    in the photographs are important to de-stigmatize and encourage continuing services in the future.

                    In this class I would like to develop skills to become someone who is able to take on the role of image-capturer for others. 
                    I hope to orient photography and digital life as, Sontag says, "invitations to deduction, speculation, and fantasy". To unlearn
                    the habit of "photograph-tokens", approach image making as a process, and not presume it as stationary.
